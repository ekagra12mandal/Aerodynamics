            <div>Airplanes are very heavy, so it may seem strange that they are able to lift off the ground and fly.
                Flight is possible because of a balance of four different physical forces, which are lift, drag, weight,
                and thrust. Lift and weight balance each other and thrust and drag must be present in just the right
                amounts. <br><br>​</div>
            <p><strong>Thrust</strong><br>Thrust is a force that moves an aircraft in the direction of the motion. It is
                created with a propeller, jet engine, or rocket. Air is pulled in and then pushed out in an opposite
                direction. One example is a household fan.<br><br></p>
            <p><strong>Weight</strong><br>Weight is the force caused by gravity. <br><br></p>
            <p><strong>Drag</strong><br>Drag is the force that acts opposite to the direction of motion. It tends to
                slow an object. Drag is caused by friction and differences in air pressure. An example is putting your
                hand out of a moving car window and feeling it pull back. <br><br></p>
